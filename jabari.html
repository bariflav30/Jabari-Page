                    <p>Hello, my name is Jabari Augustin, and I would like to welcome you to my portfolio page. I'm a graduate of Andrews University with a Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Imaging Technology, I've been working in the Web Development field since 2007 as Graphic/Web Designer and I shifted my focus in becoming a Front End Web Developer. Lately, I've been diving deeper in studying more about HTML 5 and CSS/CSS3 while putting it into practice, as well as learning the use of JavaScript and JQuery to enhance your website.</p>
            <br>
                    <p>Being a Front End Developer is my life. It's my five-star hotel. It's my bread and butter, when I wake up in the morning. It's something that I dream about when I go to sleep at night and then wake up and turn it into a reality. Without Web Development my world would be gray. I can tell about the struggles that I went through just to get to this spot in life, but instead I rather let you know to always follow your dreams and turn it into goals. Don't doubt yourself, I believe that in order to get where you want to be in life, you got to have more faith and less fear. </p>
            <br>
                    <p>Besides my love for Web Development, I enjoy playing basketball, football, ping pong, listening to music, traveling to new places, playing video games, doing research on technology and history, installing car audio systems, learning new things and even creating new things for my personal use(LOL). I just really love sports, I'm a huge Patriots, Lions, and Celtic Fan. Other than that, I'm a pretty laid back guy that just enjoys life and embrace whatever it throws at me.</p>
